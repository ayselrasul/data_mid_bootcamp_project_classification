## General Information

Situation:

 Apart from the other banking and loan services, the bank also provides credit card services that are a very important source of revenue for the bank. The bank wants to understand the demographics and other characteristics of its customers that accept a credit card offer and that do not accept a credit card.
 
 Usually, the observational data for these kinds of problems is somewhat limited in that often the company sees only those who respond to an offer. To get around this, the bank designs a focused marketing study, with 18,000 current bank customers. This focused approach allows the bank to know who does and does not respond to the offer, and to use existing demographic data that is already available on each customer.



## Objectives

Build a model that will provide insight into why some bank customers accept credit card offers.
There are also other potential areas of opportunities that the bank wants to understand from the data.
Help the senior management to understand their customers better.
